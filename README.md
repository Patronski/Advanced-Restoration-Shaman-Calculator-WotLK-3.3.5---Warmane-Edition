# Thank you for being here!
The idea for the program was given by Radosvet Milchev, a.k.a. Teamy in Warmane servers. He is a bad ass wow gamer in pve world. Mostly playing Resto Shaman, Holy Paladin, which of course are max geared.

Developing is done by Doncho Patronski, who is me. This is my first real Windows Forms application(.Net). The project is bigger than I expected, a lot of controlls and classes, especially the main form. I am glad that I managed to make some abstractions and automations with Reflection.

## Input
In the calculator can be inserted a character's data like **Intellect**, **Bonus Healing**(spell power), **Haste Rating**, **Crit Rating**, **Mana regen**. Also there are a lot of options for Haste, Crit, Tier Bonuses, Glyphs, Meta Gems, Totems and other modifiers.

## Output
Ð¢here is drop down menu where will be presented an information for the spells(**Chain Heal, Earth Shield, Gift of Naaru, Healing Stream Totem, Healing Wave, Lesser Healing Wave, Riptide**) and there is huge section for mana spent/gain *(**MP5** (also known as MP/5) is a shortened term for the attribute that is itemized as "Restores X mana per 5 sec." or "Mana per 5 seconds".).*

## Help
In the program there is an Info button with more detailed explanations.

## Tallents
Tallents for Resto Shaman are included.

## Tooltips
There are a lot of tooltips in the form of pictures or text.

## Video
Yes, there are videos, pictures, sounds and colored text to look more shiny. :D
